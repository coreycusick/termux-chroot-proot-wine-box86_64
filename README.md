# Termux chroot / proot with Wine, Box86, and GPU

## Getting started

You can set up everything using this command in Termux (Github version):

    yes | pkg update -y && pkg install -y wget && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreycusick/termux-chroot-proot-wine-box86_64/main/Scripts/Getting_Started.sh && chmod +x Getting_Started.sh && ./Getting_Started.sh && rm Getting_Started.sh
	
I recommend you to try [Winlator](https://winlator.com/), as it have a nice interface and can run X86, X64 programs almost the same as this script. Of course you will give up advanced customization and picking a custom version of Wine ðŸ« .

This script will:
- Clone this git and scripts;
- Create an Ubuntu proot with alias ubuntu_box86;
- Install Termux:X11 app and package, Termux:Widget app;
- Add packages as pulseaudio, virglrenderer, xwayland, etc.;
- Create shortcuts to launch XFCE in proot using the Termux:Widget;
- Set up the proot with Box86, Box64, Wine32 and Wine64;

[Addons_Menu.sh](Scripts/Addons_Menu.sh): Let you, in:
- Termux: Set-up mesa-zink and compatible virgl server.
- Termux: Create an alias to enter in Ubuntu proot.
- Proot: Add new user named 'box'.
- Proot: Set up Bash x86 and x64 with Box86 and Box64.
- Proot: Install Steam. NOTE: Doesn't start completely now.
- Proot: Compile and install GL4ES.
- Proot: Install native PlayOnLinux with Box86_64 support.
- Proot: Install Mesa Turnip Adreno KGSL compatible driver.

Current versions: Wine 8.7 from [Wine-Builds](https://github.com/Kron4ek/Wine-Builds), latest Box86_64 from [ryanfortner](https://github.com/ryanfortner), [Termux:Widget v0.13](https://github.com/termux/termux-widget/releases/tag/v0.13.0) (Github), [Termux:X11 v1.02.07](https://github.com/termux/termux-x11/actions/runs/4524914392) (Github).
